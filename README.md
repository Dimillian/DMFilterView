DMFilterView
============

A `UIView` subclass which add itself at the bottom of any view.

##What is it ? 
`DMFilterView` is a subclass of `UIView`, it look like a `UITabBar` but it much more lighter to implement. You just init it with an `NSArray` of strings and then attach it to your view. 
It provides some easy delegate and customization functions.

For example I use it in [MySeeen](http://myseeenapp.com) to filter the MySeeen grid view, and I think this is the primary functionality of this control, it should act as a filter 
In the provided example I show you how to hide and show it regarding a `UITableView` scroll. 
Cool heh?

Note: You should change provided images by your own before using in your application.

##Feature
1. Easy to use.
2. Fully animated (Selection, show, hide).
3. Easy customization. (fonts, colors, etcâ€¦)
4. Change the background image or replace it by a color, and change the selected image or color.
5. Ultra lite

##How to use
Add `DMFilterView` to your project and do something like this in a view or view a view controller

	_filterView = [[DMFilterView alloc]initWithStrings:@[@"ABC", @"Filter 1", @"Filter 2"] containerView:self.view];
	[self.filterView attachToContainerView];

Then you need to implement the only `@required` delegate method which is

	- (void)filterView:(DMFilterView *)filterView didSelectedAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
	{
	   //Place your filter logic here
	}

`DMFilterView` also provides some other delegate `@optional` method such as

	- (CGFloat)filterViewDisplayAnimatioSpeed:(DMFilterView *)filterView;
	- (CGFloat)filterViewSelectionAnimationSpeed:(DMFilterView *)filterView;
