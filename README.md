DMFilterView
============

A `UIView` subclass which add itself at the bottom of any view.

##What is it ? 
`DMFilterView` is a subclass of `UIView`, it look like a `UITabBar` but it much more lighter to implement. You just init it with an `NSArray` of strings and then attach it to your view. 
It provides some easy delegate and customization functions.

I made it for[MySeeen](http://myseeenapp.com) to filter the MySeeen grid view, and I think this is the primary functionality of this control, it should act as a filter 
In the provided example I show you how to hide and show it regarding a `UITableView` scrolling events. 
Cool heh?

Note: You should change provided images by your own before using in your application.

##Features
1. Easy to use.
2. Fully animated (selection, show, hide).
3. Support dragging for the selected button, so you can drag the selector to selection view to a new selection.
4. Easy customization. (fonts, colors, etcâ€¦).
5. Change the background image or replace it by a color, and change the selected image or color.
6. Ultra lite

##How to use it
Add `DMFilterView` to your project and do something like this in a view or view a view controller or anywhere you want

	_filterView = [[DMFilterView alloc]initWithStrings:@[@"ABC", @"Filter 1", @"Filter 2"] containerView:self.view];
	[self.filterView attachToContainerView];

Then you need to implement the only `@required` delegate method which is

	- (void)filterView:(DMFilterView *)filterView didSelectedAtIndex:(NSInteger)index
	{
	   //Place your filter logic here
	}

`DMFilterView` also provides some other delegate `@optional` method such as

	- (CGFloat)filterViewDisplayAnimatioSpeed:(DMFilterView *)filterView;
	- (CGFloat)filterViewSelectionAnimationSpeed:(DMFilterView *)filterView;

In the provided example I show you some customization possibilities that DMFilterView offer.

Every properties and methods in the header are commented, it should be easy for you to read and know how to customize things. I also provide some examples with 3 differents style for you to play with.
